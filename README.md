# IOHK Frontend Technical Assessment

Create a Next.js application that displays a list of users and some charts and graphs about this user dataset across 2 tabs.

Features:
1. Display the list of users on the first tab. Display table with the list of user's Names and Surnames. User dataset provided
2. Show User Overview on the second tab
  - Create a Visualization that can best display the amount of dependents by country
  - Create a Visualization that can best display the various age groups that exist in the dataset.
  - Create any other visualization that you think will better demonstrate your skill set
3. Add a gender filter on top of the overview page that will filter all data displayed on the visualization.

The goal of this assessment is to see how you go about solving this problem. Feel free to add anything that could demonstrate your competency and various principles and standards you believe in and adhere to. Ie. Unit testing, various design patterns etc

We will go through a peer review process in the next round of interviews where you can present what you have done and explain your thinking and how you ended up with your current implementation.

No need to deploy this as long as it runs locally that's fine.
